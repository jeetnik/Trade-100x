    //     How Real-World Perpetuals Handle Funding Rate Payments
    // Margin Stays Intact:

    // The margin (used for maintaining the position) is not reduced by funding rate payments.
    // This ensures that the trader's position isn't liquidated due to funding rate payments alone.
    // Funding Rate Deducted from Available Balance:

    // The payment is taken from the traderâ€™s available deposit (free balance).
    // If there is insufficient balance, the margin may be adjusted (which could lead to liquidation if it falls below maintenance margin).
    // If Deposit is Insufficient:

    // The system may try to deduct the funding rate from the margin, but this can lead to liquidation if the margin falls below maintenance requirements.
